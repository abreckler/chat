I remember the day well, because we met at the Brainwash Cafe on Folsom street, on the day of the Folsom street fair, which we both found out during our meeting was a bad time and place for a business meeting.</p><p name="1e16" id="1e16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had responded to a craigslist posting for a ‘Contract CSS Developer’, which, we agreed would cost a price of $200 to develop a static html homepage for their yet to launch web site, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011030642/http://airbedandbreakfast.com/" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011030642/http://airbedandbreakfast.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">airbedandbreakfast.com</a>.</p><p name="3def" id="3def" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What often gets lost in the public narratives of startup success stories is the account of the early days. What follows is the story of how a seemingly small idea transformed into a truly transformative company.</p><p name="19d9" id="19d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What you see here in the background is the first version of Airbnb (known back then in October 2007 as AirBed &amp; Breakfast). Its not exactly the epitome of design we know and love their service for today, but it was the start of something big.</p><h3 name="ea6c" id="ea6c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Third time’s a charm</h3><p name="0552" id="0552" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The original idea for what became Airbnb was a clever way for design conference participants (co-founders Joe and Brian) to find and rent out their apartment space to make money. There were many iterations along the way to their eventual success, but the three following versions where the most important evolutionary steps.</p><p name="43b1" id="43b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Version 1</strong>: Rent out your mattress to a fellow conference goer from out of town.

Although the core of the idea that eventually made Airbnb a success was present here. Limited by the frequency of events and building up enough early supply, the idea failed to take off. You can see from the screenshot above that the original planned business model was even brand sponsorship instead of the transaction fee model they have today.</p><p name="e096" id="e096" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Version 2: </strong>Rent out your spare bedroom to weary travelers on the cheap to make $$ towards rent.

There wasn’t any data to back this decision originally. They just went and did it. A week later, the results were in: improving the pictures doubled the weekly revenue to $400 per week. This was the first financial improvement that the company had seen in over eight months. They knew they were onto something.</blockquote><blockquote name="a102" id="a102" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">This was the turning point for the company. </strong>Gebbia shared that the team initially believed that everything they did had to be ‘scalable.’ It was only when they gave themselves permission to experiment with non-scalable changes to the business that they climbed out of what they called the ‘trough of sorrow.’ — <a href="http://firstround.com/article/How-design-thinking-transformed-Airbnb-from-failing-startup-to-billion-dollar-business" data-href="http://firstround.com/article/How-design-thinking-transformed-Airbnb-from-failing-startup-to-billion-dollar-business" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How Design Thinking Transformed Airbnb from a Failing Startup to a Billion Dollar Business</a></blockquote><p name="8122" id="8122" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Version 3 and beyond</strong>: Rent out your entire home or apartment to a verified and trusted stranger. “Travel like a human being”.

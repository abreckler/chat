The kinds of content we were initially expecting people to share ran the gamut from screenshots of product issues, inspirations of competitors features to insights from analytics charts &amp; graphs.</p><p name="5859" id="5859" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Taking a step back: </strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">At its core</em>, Prism’s long-term mission is to provide more transparency to the workplace through better contextual communication.</p><p name="b4db" id="b4db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Prism started out life as a completely open canvas. It was entirely up for the user to decide (or guess) as to what type of content to contribute and what kinds of problems or jobs prism was performing for them.</p><p name="8be3" id="8be3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Along the early path we were struggling with the first few steps to take to get from here (open canvas) to there -&gt; (canvas full of engaging visual content worth conversing around and sharing).</p><p name="aa16" id="aa16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some questions that kept resurfacing in our heads included:</p><p name="e534" id="e534" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How are we going to communicate the value of prism to new users in less than 15 seconds?</em></p><p name="39c6" id="39c6" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How are we going to communicate the value of using something like prism vs the more traditional route of native OS copy and paste to share?</em></p><p name="4d02" id="4d02" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How are we going to communicate the use cases for contributing content to prism vs the existing alternatives, email, trello or slack?</em></p><p name="3a9d" id="3a9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we began to ask these questions of our selves, we realized we didn’t have straight-forward answers.</p><p name="5d2a" id="5d2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is when we decided to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">immediately stop listening to customer feedback </em></strong>and go through a 2 week long process of using prism for ourselves for our own product development process to generate ideas, inspirations and feedback for new use cases and product features that we would use.</p><h4 name="5726" id="5726" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Insight</h4><p name="b4c1" id="b4c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">During this time we started using prism to build prism by inviting select groups of our alpha tester community, at the time about 100, to give their feedback on things like our logo design and product homepage.</p><p name="10b9" id="10b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The initial response was very strong. As it turns out giving feedback is a much more lighter weight action than contributing content to receive feedback or setting up a board to solve a business problem and inviting colleagues (duh!).</p><p name="ff7b" id="ff7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Example: </strong>Here’s how we<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>used prism to get feedback on our logo.</p><figure name="2dde" id="2dde" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pSP2OazJW2F5AiVE66f2jw.png" data-width="1211" data-height="328" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pSP2OazJW2F5AiVE66f2jw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The evolution of our logo from the triangle on the left, to the ‘snapshot’ inspired prism lens icon on the far right -&gt;</figcaption></figure><p name="e284" id="e284" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The result of this experiment was a much improved output (logo) than we would have otherwise been able to make and by being able to leverage so many different points-of-view in the process who were ‘outside of the building’, we were able to act in a much more un-biased way to the feedback.</p><figure name="8a27" id="8a27" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*xTNA4Lnstft-4FYn456vtA.png" data-width="336" data-height="317" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*xTNA4Lnstft-4FYn456vtA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The logo we arrived at after many rounds of feedback</figcaption></figure><h4 name="8383" id="8383" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Lessons Learned</h4><p name="048b" id="048b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lesson #1:</strong> While initially it felt slightly uncomfortable to open up our current product process and future plans to people, some of whom we don’t even know personally, the benefits of being transparent have far outweighed any perceived downsides thus far.</p><p name="d4f6" id="d4f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Receiving honest and direct feedback is kind-of like ripping off a band-aid, again, and again…and again.</p><p name="c66e" id="c66e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The more times you do it the easier it gets.</p><p name="e974" id="e974" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lesson #2</strong>: Providing a light-weight form of capturing feedback is very valuable, since you don’t want to waste the time of the person who is giving you their feedback. Streamlining this experience will be a key differentiator for prism in the future and is a key product learning.</p><p name="2dbc" id="2dbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lesson #3: </strong>The other lesson that we learned was that people in the community (people building products) are extremely generous with their time because they fundamentally believe that ‘paying it forward’ tends to pay off over time.</p><h4 name="5b6b" id="5b6b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What’s Next?</h4><p name="289b" id="289b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Following the success of our dog-fooding experiment within the product/design/branding use-case, we aim to continue to increase the level of transparency even further and see where it take us...</p><p name="5147" id="5147" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some ideas we have right now are to:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="4b45" id="4b45" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Open up a public board for prism product feedback.
